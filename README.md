# Auto Mark as Read

## Description
A Jetpack based Firefox extension, which automatically marks articles in your feedly cloud as read, when you read them on their website.
The extension checks the URL of a tab against the article URL and only if they match the article is marked as read. The extension tries to remove some of the analytics garbage,
which could cause unexpected behaviour with sites using GET arguments extensively.
